# Project: Next.js Landing Page

_Current Version:_ 0.0.1

# Description:

The primary goal of this project is to learn about the Next.js framework. By
creating this landing page, I hope to solidify my understanding of Next.js and
have a working template that can be reused in my future projects.

# Features/Sections:

_Overview:_

The website will be a single paged Next.js application. The fixed navbar at the
top will link to other parts of the page so users can quickly find what they're
looking for.

- An attractive Hero Banner with a background SVG
- Features section that outlines the product/services benefits
- Service Section which provides the user with an idea of what they can expect
  after purchasing the service
- Team section which provides an overview of the companies staff
- The all important testimonial section that utilizes social proof so customers
  feel at ease with purchasing this product/service
- Footer section with a sitemap and extra details about the company

## Getting Started

For those who wish to utilzies this template, you should first download/clone
the repo from my [github](https://github.com/IM-Deane/nextjs-landing-page).

After you've downloaded the template, you can open it in your favorite code
editor (I used VS Code) and install the dependencies.

For the novices, to install the dependencies you should use a package manager
such as npm or yarn (I used npm). Once one of these have been enabled, you can
open your terminal in VS Code, and run the manager's install command (npm
install).

After the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server
using your package manager (npm run dev). The server should default to
http://localhost:3000.

Here is an example to get you going:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn
yarn dev
```
